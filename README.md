# ClosedLoopTestNano

A small program for the Arduino Nano so I can play around with DC motors that use quadrature encoders, and PWM driver boards.

It uses all (both) interrupt pins of the Nano to count the motor's position up and down, and drives a H-bridge board via the PWM pins 9 and 10 of the Nano.
